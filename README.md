# Java-Streams-Playground
This is my demo project for solving some easy, not so easy, middle-difficult collection-processing problems which I stumbled upon.   I use this project only for practicing and using Java Stream API for problems which I find interesting to solve only using streams.  Every package is problem for itself. Usually there will be a Main class with main() which you can call to get the output.  In each package, there will be some kind of text/image file which describes the current problem.  Also, within in some packages there will be a Repository class which will initialize necessary and dependent objects.  Happy streams coding!
